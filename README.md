# python_Sockets
A Python script that creates a simple TCP/IP server and client using sockets, allowing messages to be sent and received between the two



To use this code you must check what the ip address for your computer(server) and the ip address for another computer(client) 'you can set the client and the server the same ip address if you want to get the send and recive the messages to the same computer'



then you will open the 'CMD' and navigate to the path that server.py and the client.py exist
enter the commadn:  python server.py (that will start the server to recive messages from the client) 
and open another cmd and open the client.py


when you enter the python client.py then the another cmd that run the server.py will recive a message
